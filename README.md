# [Circular Slide Rule](http://drknotter.github.io/circular-slide-rule)

A demo of a working circular slide rule. Try dragging the pointer and the inner stator. This project eventually led to a [real life object](http://www.instructables.com/id/Circular-Slide-Rule/). Coded entirely in HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
